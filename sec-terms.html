                            15.5 Where Goods are handled out from store Our
                            liability will cease upon handling over the Goods to
                            Your authorised representative.

                        <p>
                            15.6 We will not be liable for any loss or damage
                            caused by Us or Our employees or agents in
                            circumstances where:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            (a) There is no breach of this Agreement by Us by
                            any of Our employees or agents.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            (b) Such loss or damage is not a reasonably
                            foreseeable result of any such breach.

                        <p>16 Damage to property other than Goods</p>
                        <p>
                            16.1 Because third party contractors or others are
                            frequently present at the time of collection or
                            delivery, it is not always possible to establish who
                            was responsible for any loss or damage, therefore
                            our liability is limited as follows;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            16.2 If we cause loss or damage to premises or
                            property other than goods for removal as a result of
                            Our negligence or breach of contract, Our liability
                            shall be limited to making good the damaged area
                            only.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            16.3 If We cause damage as a result of moving goods
                            under Your express instructions, against our advice,
                            and where moving goods in the manner instructed is
                            likely to cause damage, We shall not be liable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            16.4 If We are responsible for causing damage to
                            Your premises or to property other than goods
                            submitted for removal and/or storage, You must note
                            this on the worksheet or delivery receipt as soon as
                            practically possible after the damage occurs or is
                            discovered or in any event within a reasonable time.
                            This is fundamental to the Agreement.
                        </p>
                        <p>17 Time limit for reporting claims</p>
                        <p>
                            17.1 If You or Your authorised representative
                            collect the goods, We must be notified in writing of
                            any loss or damage at the time the goods are handed
                            to You or Your agent otherwise we shall not be
                            liable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            17.2 If it is believed that the Remover has been
                            responsible for loss and/or damage to goods and/or
                            premises, such claims must be made verbally within 3
                            working days of the alleged incident, and confirmed
                            in writing within 7 working days of the alleged
                            incident. Any claim brought outside these time
                            periods will not be accepted.

                            If there is a dispute arising from this Contract,
                            which cannot be resolved, either party may refer it

                        <p>
                            19.1 Goods received or held by the Remover are
                            subject:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            19.1.1 To a particular lien for the payment of
                            removal or storage charges, and
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            19.1.2 To a general lien for all monies owed to the
                            Remover for any services rendered to you under this
                            or any other contract.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            19.2 If the lien is not satisfied within 28 days of
                            the Remover"s notification of the exercise of such
                            lien, the Remover shall be entitled to sell Your
                            goods and apply the proceeds of sale towards
                            satisfaction of the lien.
                        </p>
                        <p>20 Sub-contracting</p>
                        <p>
                            The Remover reserves the right to subcontract all or
                            part of the Work. If the Remover subcontracts the
                            Work it does so as your agent which means that the
                            removal will still be carried out in accordance
                            with, and subject to, these Terms.
                        </p>
                        <p>21 Inter-change and method</p>
                        <p>
                            The Remover may at any time inter-change goods
                            between vehicles and warehouses and may choose which
                            route or by which means the goods shall be carried.
                        </p>
                        <p>22 Inventory</p>
                        <p>
                            Where an inventory is prepared it shall be deemed to
                            be conclusive evidence of the Customer"s goods that
                            are stored, unless the Remover receives the
                            Customer"s notification in writing of any error or
                            omission within 7 days of the receipt of the
                            inventory. Such notification shall not be effective
                            unless acknowledged in writing by the Remover. The
                            Remover agrees to make this acknowledgement promptly
                            upon receipt of this notification.

                        <p>
                            23.1 Either party may, by written notice, terminate
                            the Contract immediately if the other party breaches
                            any of its obligations under the Contract, and the
                            breach (if capable of being remedied) remains
                            unremedied for 14 days after written notice of such
                            breach has been served.
                        </p>

                            23.2 Either party may also terminate the Contract

                            Contract under 17 We shall be entitled to cancel or
                            suspend the Work without any liability to You and if
                            Work has been carried out but not paid for, the

                            return of the third party contractor. The Customer

                        <p>
                            28.1 Storage charges are payable 3 months in
                            advance. If the Customer removes the Goods from
                            storage before the expiration of the 3 month period,
                            the Remover will credit the account of the Customer
                            for the unexpired portion of such period. This
                            allowance will not be given for periods of less than

                            charges from time to time. The Remover will give the
