                            to on the quotation - 20% of the (removal) charge stated on the

                        <p>14 Removers Liability</p>
                        <p>
                            14.1 We do not know the value of Your Goods and therefore We limit Our
                            liability to a fixed limit per item. The amount of liability We accept
                            under this agreement is reflected in Our charges for the Work. If you
                            wish Us to increase Our limit of liability per item You agree to pay a
                            higher price for the Work.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            14.2 Unless otherwise agreed in writing if we are negligent or in breach
                            of contract We will pay You up to £40 for each item which is lost or
                            damaged as a direct result of any negligence or breach of contract on
                            Our part.

                            explosion, unless we have been negligent or in breach of contract. It is
                            Your responsibility to insure Your Goods. If you ask Us in writing to
                            arrange insurance cover for You We will, provided You declare the full
                            replacement value of Your Goods and pay the premium in advance.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            15.3 Other than as a result of Our negligence or breach of contract We
                            will not be liable for any loss, damage or failure to produce the goods

                        <p>
                            15.3.10 For the items referred to in Clause 10 (Goods not to be
                            submitted for removal)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            15.4 No employee of Ours shall be separately liable to You for any loss,
                            damage, mis-delivery, errors or omissions under the terms of this
                            Agreement.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            15.5 Where Goods are handled out from store Our liability will cease
                            upon handling over the Goods to Your authorised representative.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            15.6 We will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by Us or Our
                            employees or agents in circumstances where:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            (a) There is no breach of this Agreement by Us by any of Our employees
                            or agents.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            (b) Such loss or damage is not a reasonably foreseeable result of any
                            such breach.
                        </p>

                        <p>16 Damage to property other than Goods</p>
                        <p>
                            Because third party contractors or others are frequently present at the
                            time of collection or delivery, it is not always possible to establish
                            who was responsible for any loss or damage, therefore our liability is
                            limited as follows;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            16.1 If we cause loss or damage to premises or property other than goods
                            for removal as a result of Our negligence or breach of contract, Our
                            liability shall be limited to making good the damaged area only.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            16.2 If We cause damage as a result of moving goods under Your express
                            instructions, against our advice, and where moving goods in the manner
                            instructed is likely to cause damage, We shall not be liable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            16.3 If We are responsible for causing damage to Your premises or to
                            property other than goods submitted for removal and/or storage, You must
                            note this on the worksheet or delivery receipt as soon as practically
                            possible after the damage occurs or is discovered or in any event within
                            a reasonable time. This is fundamental to the Agreement.
                        </p>

                        <p>17 Time limit for reporting claims</p>
                        <p>
                            If it is believed that the Remover has been responsible for loss and/or
                            damage to goods and/or premises, such claims must be made verbally
                            within 3 working days of the alleged incident, and confirmed in writing
                            within 7 working days of the alleged incident. Any claim brought outside
                            these time periods will not be accepted.
                        </p>
                        <p>18 Disputes</p>
                        <p>
                            If there is a dispute arising from this Contract, which cannot be
                            resolved, either party may refer it to the English courts in accordance
                            with Clause 25.
                        </p>

                        <p>19 Our Right to Hold the Goods (Lien)</p>
                        <p>19.1 Goods received or held by the Remover are subject:</p>
                        <p>
                            19.1.1 To a particular lien for the payment of removal or storage
                            charges, and
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            19.1.2 To a general lien for all monies owed to the Remover for any
                            services rendered to you under this or any other contract.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            19.2 If the lien is not satisfied within 28 days of the Remover's
                            notification of the exercise of such lien, the Remover shall be entitled
                            to sell Your goods and apply the proceeds of sale towards satisfaction
                            of the lien.
                        </p>

                        <p>20 Sub-contracting</p>
                        <p>
                            The Remover reserves the right to subcontract all or part of the Work.
                            If the Remover subcontracts the Work it does so as your agent which
                            means that the removal will still be carried out in accordance with, and
                            subject to, these Terms.
                        </p>

                        <p>21 Inter-change and method</p>
                        <p>
                            The Remover may at any time inter-change goods between vehicles and
                            warehouses and may choose which route or by which means the goods shall
                            be carried.
                        </p>

                        <p>22 Inventory</p>
                        <p>
                            Where an inventory is prepared it shall be deemed to be conclusive
                            evidence of the Customer's goods that are stored, unless the Remover
                            receives the Customer's notification in writing of any error or omission
                            within 7 days of the receipt of the inventory. Such notification shall
                            not be effective unless acknowledged in writing by the Remover. The
                            Remover agrees to make this acknowledgement promptly upon receipt of
                            this notification.
                        </p>

                        <p>23 Termination</p>
                        <p>
                            23.1 Either party may, by written notice, terminate the Contract
                            immediately if the other party breaches any of its obligations under the
                            Contract, and the breach (if capable of being remedied) remains
                            unremedied for 14 days after written notice of such breach has been
                            served.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            23.2 Either party may also terminate the Contract immediately by giving
                            notice in writing if the other;
